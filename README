/*********OCAML KMP **************/

To compile:

"ocamlopt -o [target] kmp.ml" in terminal, or type in "make".


Description:

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is able to search for a single or multiple occurrence of a string within a larger volume of text in O(n) time. Being able to find the string in O(n) makes it a perfect algorithm. This project aims to recreate the same computational power but in a completely functional way.
